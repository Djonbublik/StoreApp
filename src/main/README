An application has been implemented that displays the activity
of an electronics store.

A connecting table "Employee-Type of electronics" has been implemented to store information about
the employee's ability to advise the buyer on different types
of electronics (the implementation of communication is "many to many"), while when adding
a purchase record, the seller, who does not contain the corresponding etype, cannot
make the purchase for himself.
ï‚§ The ability to add and edit entries to the main
registries has been implemented.
